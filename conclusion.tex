On of the most difficult parts of planning an introductory information security
class is addressing the wide degree of backgrounds and aptitudes in a diverse
student body.
In this work we have presented a lesson plan for using card magic to each
information security concepts to novices.  Our use of this lesson plan in a
real-world teaching environment has shown that it is highly effective at both
fostering student engagement and improving their mastery of the covered
material.
We encourage our fellow educators to use the tricks we have developed and to
develop new tricks as a way to make complex and potentially intimidating
material more approachable for novice students with varying backgrounds.
