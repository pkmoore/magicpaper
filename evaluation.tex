\section{Evaluation}
\label{SEC:evaluation}

We evaluated our lessons as part of a high-school level computer science
summer program with a total of AAA students.  Each student was first given
a pre-test to assess their knowledge prior to the lessons.  After each
lesson, students completed a post-test to see if their scores improved.
Students were also given a survey that allows them to report both how well
they believe they learned the material and their opinions of the lessons in
general.

  \item{The demonstration helped me understand the dangers of social
    engineering.}

  \item{I better understand what types of
    information are personal and should not
    be shared.}

  \item{I can identify situations where someone is using a distraction
    to steal my personal information.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{enumerate}

  \item{The demonstration tied in well with the material being presented}

  \item{Using a demonstration made it more likely for me to remember the
    presented information}

  \item{I prefer an interactive demonstration to a non-interactive lecture}

%The PAS helped me understand where the memory for local, global, and static
%variables is allocated.
%
%The PAS helped me to see how a buffer overflow can change the values of
%variables adjacent to the buffer that was overflowed
%
%I understand process execution better after using the PAS
%
%I was able to identify concepts I did not understand after using the
%software
%
%The PAS window enhanced the course of the area of program execution
%
%The text of the PAS window was easy to read
%
%It was easy to identify one stack frame from another
%
%It was easy to identify the contents of each stack frame
%
%It was easy to identify the address and value of variables in the data
